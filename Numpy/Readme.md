## 📖 What is NumPy?
**NumPy** (Numerical Python) is the core library for scientific computing in Python. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object and tools for working with these arrays. 

> **Technical Note:** While NumPy is used via Python, it is primarily **based on C**. This allows it to perform complex mathematical operations at much higher speeds than standard Python lists by utilizing contiguous memory allocation.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The learning path is divided into four detailed Jupyter notebooks:

### 1. Basics of Array & Vector Generation
This notebook covers the essentials of initializing and inspecting NumPy objects.
* **Basic Array Creation:** Transforming standard Python sequences into arrays.
* **Array Generation Functions:** Using `np.arange()`, `np.zeros()`, and `np.ones()`.
* **Random Generation:** Creating data using `np.random` for simulations.
* **Array Methods & Attributes:** Exploring properties like `.shape`, `.ndim`, and `.dtype`.
* **Reshaping and Resizing:** Changing the structure of data without altering its values.

### 2. Indexing and Slicing
Focused on data retrieval from both 1D vectors and N-dimensional matrices.
* **Vector Indexing & Slicing:** Standard techniques for 1D data.
* **Matrix Indexing & Slicing:** Navigating rows and columns in multi-dimensional arrays.
* **Boolean Indexing:** Filtering arrays based on logical conditions (a crucial skill for data cleaning).



### 3. Matrix Operations & Broadcasting
Exploring the mathematical engine of NumPy and advanced manipulation.
* **Array Operations:** Element-wise math and universal functions.
* **Broadcasting:** How NumPy handles operations between arrays of different dimensions.
* **Deep vs. Shallow Copy:** Understanding memory management to prevent data corruption.
* **Matrix Operations:** Linear algebra basics.
* **Advanced Manipulation:** Stacking (joining) and Splitting arrays.



### 4. NumPy Practice Exercises
A comprehensive exercise notebook designed to test and solidify the concepts covered in the first three notebooks through practical problem-solving.
