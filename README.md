# Python & AI/ML Foundation

This repository tracks my progress from Python fundamentals to advanced software engineering concepts, serving as the base for my future AI and Machine Learning projects.

---

## 📌 Roadmap & Topics Covered

The repository is structured to show a logical progression of skills:

### 1. Python Fundamentals (with Exercises)
* **Data Structures**: Deep dive into Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries.
* **Control Flow**: Mastery of conditionals (`if-elif-else`) and loops (`for`, `while`).
* **Functional Programming**: Writing reusable code with functions, including scope and arguments.

### 2. Advanced Python Concepts
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Implementing classes, inheritance, and encapsulation.
* **Closures & Decorators**: Enhancing function behavior and managing state.
* **Error Handling**: Using `try-except` blocks to build resilient applications.
* **File Handling**: Reading and writing data using the `json` format.

### 3. Environment & Tools
* **Virtual Environments**: Using `venv` to manage isolated dependencies for different projects.

## 🛠️ Projects & Practical Applications

### 1. Video Manager (File Handling)
* **Goal**: Manage a video library using persistent storage.
* **Features**: Uses the `json` module to read from and write data to a local file.
* **Concepts**: File I/O, JSON parsing, and data serialization.

### 2. Video Manager (Database Integration)
* **Goal**: Upgrade the Video Manager to use a real database.
* **Features**: Built using the `sqlite3` module for structured data management.
* **Concepts**: SQL queries, CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), and database connections.

### 3. API Handling
* **Goal**: Interact with real-world data from the web.
* **Features**: Used the `requests` package to fetch and handle API responses.
* **Concepts**: HTTP methods, status codes, and external package management.
