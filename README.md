## ⚙️ Local Setup & Installation

To run these notebooks on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```powershell
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
   cd your-repo-name
2. **Create a Central Virtual Environment:**

   Instead of using per-folder environments, we use a single root environment to manage all modules efficiently:

   ```powershell
   python -m venv venv
3. **Activate the Environment:**

   ```powershell
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
4. **Install Consolidated Dependencies:**
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
5. **Select Interpreter in VS Code:**
   To ensure your Jupyter Notebooks use the correct environment:
   
   1. Open any `.ipynb` file in your repository.

   2. Click on "Select Kernel" in the top right corner(or press `Ctrl + Shift + P`).
   
   3. Search for and choose **"Python: Select Interpreter"**.
   
   4. Select the environment located at: `./venv/Scripts/python.exe`.
